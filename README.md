# HowToAConductDeveloperInterviews
A guide on what to ask and look for while interviewing candidates to hire as software developers

Offlate there is lot of negativity on whiteboard interviews. The general feeling is that they are unfair to candiates for various reasons
1) Candidate is not good at standing up and writing/thinking
2) Candiate has no or less context than the interviewer
3) Does not mimic real working conditions, for example no access to online tools like http://Stackoverflow.com
4) Interviewer may know the final answer but has never really solved it himself, so he does not understand how easy/tough it is to get to the answer
5) Candidate has no clue into how much credit they will get for a partial answer. Some interviews are ok with halk baked solutions, some insist that you should figure out the final solution, enough if it is a heuristic based answer.

In this book, We will go over a few sample interview questions and analyze a few scenarios. What are some good and bad answers, 









*Note*: Given the gender imbalance in software industry, its fair to use "He" for the interviewer.

# GutsyInterviewee aka IntervieweePushback
This is a small worksheet that you should print and give to the interviewer before he asks you a question.

Far too often, interviewers read up a question and answer and then expect you to come up with the solution in 10-15min.

Here is a small table that a potential employee must ask the interviewer to fill in before answering questions.
I plan to do this in the next interview that I attend.


Colons can be used to align columns.

| Question in Brief(1)        |  Source (2)  | Solution Details?(3) | Will you explain your solution, even if time runs out.
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| find linked list with loop      | A previous interview that I attended | Use two pointers.  | Question checks for interview preparation or that you have baseline information.
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


(1) Brief description is fine.
(2) Is the question something you solved as part of the job. Else, did you come up with it yourself. If not, where did you obtain it from?
(3) Did you come up come up with the solution yourself, or did you read it from somewhere? Would you explain the reasoning behind either approaches.
(4) Will you explain your solution and how you arrived at the solution. Will you explain how many of your co workers would be able to solve it? Will you explain how many interviewees really solve it?


If you have really done this, please  post a comment here or send an email to iamanonymouscoward@gmail.com and send me your experiences.


A few more ideas
1) Ask interviewer. I cannot answer this puzzle. But I can look up stackoverflow and explain pros and cons of the solution.
